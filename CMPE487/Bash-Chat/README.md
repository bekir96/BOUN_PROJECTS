## BASH CHAT APP

### Requirements 

- bash version: version 5.0.11(x86_64-apple-darwin18.6.0)
- netcat
- I tested with Yusuf Yüksel (You can see in `Yusuf.txt` )
- Yusuf Yüksel's student id = 2014400051

### Usage

`$ ./netcat.sh`

### Design Notes

Due to a Netcat-related or network problem, I cannot get response every time when I make announce. So I cannot change `online_user.txt` file. Therefore I do not handle user who previously appeared online is offline.
